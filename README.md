models
------

This directory contains the golang data structures on which elos relies. It should be noted, however, that this repository is not the source of true. Rather the [definitions](https://github.com/elos/definitions) repo, specifically the models subdirectory, is. These model files are mostly generated user the gen/gen.go command, based on the definitions in the aforementioned repo. The definitions repo is a submodule of this repo.
